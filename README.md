# RNAcentral sequence search embed

This is an embeddable component that you can include into your website to add a non-coding RNA sequence search.

The component sends search requests to EBI-backed API, run on EBI cloud infrastructure.

It searches against RNAcentral databases (or their arbitrary subset) with NHMMER, CMSCAN and also adds text search 
functionality, backed by EBI Lucene text search plugin.

This plugin is written in React/Redux. It is bundled as a Web Component, so it should not clash with your website's 
javascript or CSS.

## How to use

To use the latest stable version without worrying about updates, use the component's javascript package available at Github:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="https://rnacentral.github.io/rnacentral-sequence-search-embed/dist/RNAcentral-sequence-search.js"></script>`

If you prefer to install this package and perform the updates manually, see the [Installation](#Installation) section.

To use it just insert an html tag somewhere in your html:

```
<rnacentral-sequence-search databases='["miRBase"]' />
```

To show some examples and/or enable the Rfam search, use:

```
<rnacentral-sequence-search 
    databases='["miRBase"]'
    examples='[
        {"description": "miRNA hsa-let-7a-1", "urs": "URS000004F5D8", "sequence": "CUAUACAAUCUACUGUCUUUC"}
    ]
    rfam="true"
/>
```

If you want to hide one specific facet, use:
```
<rnacentral-sequence-search 
    databases='["miRBase"]'
    hideFacet='["has_conserved_structure"]'
/>
```

You can hide any facet - ` "rna_type", "TAXONOMY", "expert_db", "qc_warning_found", "has_go_annotations", 
"has_conserved_structure", "has_genomic_coordinates" `

You can also customise some elements of this embeddable component. See what you can change [here](#layout).
The example below changes the color of the buttons:

```
<rnacentral-sequence-search
    databases='["miRBase"]'
    customStyle='{
      "searchButtonColor": "#007c82",
      "clearButtonColor": "#6c757d"
    }'
/>
```

For a minimal example, see [index.html](./index.html). For an Rfam example, see [rfam.html](./rfam.html).

## Installation

Download this package directly from Github.

`git clone https://github.com/RNAcentral/rnacentral-sequence-search-embed.git`

Now you can add the component's javascript bundle (it contains all the styles and fonts) to your web page either 
directly or through an import with Webpack:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="/rnacentral-sequence-search-embed/dist/RNAcentral-sequence-search.js"></script>`

You will need to run the `git pull` command whenever there are updates.

and their values are strings (this is a requirement of Web Components):

## Developer details

### Local development

1. `npm install`

2. `npm run serve` to start a server on http://localhost:8080/

3. `npm run clean` to clean the dist folder of old assets

4. `npm run build` to generate a new distribution

### Notes

This embed is implemented as a Web Component, wrapping a piece of code in React/Redux.

Being a Web Component, it isolates CSS styles from the main page to avoid clash of styles with it.
The CSS styles and fonts are bundled into the javascript inline via Webpack 3 build system,
see webpack.config.js file. Upon load of RNAcentral-sequence-search.js, the component registers
itself in the custom elements registry.

Web Components accept input parameters as strings. That means that we have to parse
parameters in Web Component initialization code and pass the resulting objects as props to React.
Here are some examples of passing the parameters to the Web Component or from Web Component
to React:
